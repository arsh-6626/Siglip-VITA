# Siglip-VITA

**SIGLIP-based Vision for Injury and Trauma Analysis**

Siglip-VITA combines ViTPose-generated Gaussian limb heatmaps with SIGLIP embeddings to classify trauma frames into **amputation**, **wound**, or **normal**—enabling fast, interpretable, and autonomous triage.

---

##  Features
- **Multimodal fusion** – Leverages pose-based Gaussian heatmaps + SIGLIP’s vision-text embeddings for robust injury classification.
- **Real-time & batch support** – Flexible inference from live streams or stored media.
- **Optimized for performance** – Minimal overhead, GPU-accelerated inference.
